A checker for single-event upsets in your RAM.

A single-event upset (SEU), aka. single-event error (SEE) takes place when a ionising particle (radioactive radiation) hits a part of an electronic chip and changes the state of a memory cell, i.e. it flips a bit. This can happen at any time during processing. This is a problem for supercomputing applications and for circuits which are exposed to strong radiation.

Some sources claim rather high rates of SEUs of about 1 SEU per 256GB per day for non-ECC RAM. I think this is a large exaggeration. I didn't find a single SEU in 50 GB days in my non-ECC RAM. Maybe my laptop has simply very high quality RAM.
